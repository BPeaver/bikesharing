# CitiBike Bike-Sharing

CitiBike is a successful program used in New York City, with a population of over 8 million. Would a program like this work in a significantly smaller market like Des Moines, IA? While Des Moines' population of around 200,000 is only 2.5% of New York's, it is still a urban area that sees a lot of traffic due to it's status as both the state capitol and the largest city in Iowa. Below are the numbers for just one month in New York, August.

Subscribers make the up the majority of the 1.2 million rides in New York

## Analysis
### Population Breakdown

While 2.5% seems like a large drop, the Des Moines-metro area has a population of over 800,000; with 450,000 of those residents living in an "urban" setting like New York City. This brings the number of people living in urban areas in and around Des Moines to 5.6% of New York. If we apply that percentage to Des Moines, that means there is an expected CitiBike membership of close to 70,000; a respectable number.

### Time Riding

If we take 5.6% of the total hours bikes are rode in NYC (7,158,760 minutes), that would equate to roughly 400,890.56 minutes of riding in Des Moines. It would also be reasonable to expect this number to actually be higher, with Des Moines being an urban area it is not as dense as New York City and it would be reasonable to assume average ride lengths would increase appreciably.

Roughly 1/3 of bikes in New York see heavy usage, which would allow bikes to be rotated in for repairs without disrupting service

### Peak Usage Times

Busy times in New York coincide with traditional rush hour traffic times, possibly due to residents desiring an easier way to get around times when traffic is gridlocked or heavy. There is also increased usage on the weekends in the mid-afternoon as people enjoying their weekends with leisure rides through the city. Periods of  low usage are late night, as would be expected, making it an ideal time to do maintenance on the previously mentioned heavy-usage bikes. 

## Summary

With Des Moines being an urban center like New York City, albiet smaller, it would still benefit from a service like CitiBike. Assuming a comparable percentage of use, there would still be millions of minutes spent on CitiBike rides in the city throughout the year. To get a better idea of possible usage numbers, it would be beneficial to do an analysis of the rides per month for a full year in New York and adjust it to a city of Des Moines' size. Also, running a more detailed anaylsis of Des Moines' population would help, as most users in New York are males, and if Des Moines has a greater percentage of it's population being male, it could equate to more users for CitiBike.
